this was a project done during my Data Analysis Internship at Linkommunity in Technopark, Casablanca, I worked on analyzing data from an aesthetic clinic management application. My primary responsibilities included performing ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes using MongoDB and cleaning the data with Pandas in Python. I conducted exploratory data analysis EDA to uncover trends such as the seasonal variation in service demand.

I also performed customer segmentation, categorizing clients based on spending and visit frequency, which led to targeted marketing strategies. 

Through correlation analysis, I discovered that personalized consultations led to a 30% higher satisfaction score, helping the clinic improve customer satisfaction.
